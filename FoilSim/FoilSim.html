            There are several different versions of FoilSim II which
            require different levels of experience with the package,
            knowledge of aerodynamics, and computer technology.
            This web page contains the off-line student version of the  program.
            It includes an off-line user's manual which describes the
            various options available in the program. 
            More experienced users can select a
            <a href="Foil.html">version</a> of the program which does not include
            these instructions and loads faster on your computer.

       <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
           This program is designed to be interactive, so you have to work with the program.
           There are a variety of choices which you must make regarding the analysis and the display
           of results by using a <b>choice box</b>.
           A choice box has a descriptive word displayed and an arrow at the right of the
           box. To make a choice, click on the arrow, hold down and drag to
           make your selection.
           The current values of the design variables are presented to you in boxes. By convention, a white box with
           black numbers is an input box and you can change the value of the number. A black box with
           yellow numbers is an output box and the value is computed by the program.
           To change the value in an input box, select the box by moving the cursor into the box
           and clicking the mouse, then backspace over the old number, enter a new number,
           then hit the <b>Enter</b> key on your keyboard. <b>You must hit Enter
           to send the new value to the program.</b>
           For most input variables you can also use a slider located next to the input box.
           Click on the slider bar, hold down and drag the slider bar to change values, or
           you can click on the arrows at either end of the slider.
           At any time, to return to the original default conditions,
           click the red <b>Reset</b> button at the upper right of the program.
</p>
<p>
           If you see only a grey box at the top of this page, be sure that Java is
           enabled in your browser. If Java is enabled, and you are using the Windows XP
           operating system, you need to get a newer version of Java. Go to this link:
           <a href="http://www.java.com/en/index.jsp">http://www.java.com/en/index.jsp</a>,
           try the "Download It Now" button, and then select "Yes" when the download box from Sun
           pops up.
</p>
<p>
           If you experience difficulties when using the sliders to change variables,
           simply click away from the slider and then back to it.</font>

           </font><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If
           the arrows on the end of the sliders disappear, click in the areas
           where the left and right arrow images should appear, and they
           should reappear.

                  The control panel holds several choice buttons which
                  control the analysis. You can select the type of analysis,
                  the type of input and output to be displayed,
                  and the units to be used in the calculations.
                  You will always see the computed

                  The output can be presented as 
                  graphs of airfoil performance, 
                  a probe which you can move through the flowfield,
                  a lift meter, or printed
                  numerical values of certain parameters.
                  You select the type of output displayed by using the choice

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        The <b>View Window</b> contains a schematic drawing of the wing that
        you are designing and some buttons to control the schematic drawing.
        Possible choices are colored blue 
        while the selected option is colored yellow.</font></p>
      <ol>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Edge</b> shows 
          the wing as viewed looking along the leading edge. The cross section 
          appears as an airfoil or circle with the flow going from left to right. 
          You can move the picture within the window by moving the cursor into 
          the window, holding down the left mouse button, and dragging the airfoil 
          to a new location. You can also "Zoom" in close to the airfoil by using 
          the green slider at the left of the window. If you get lost, pushing 
          the red <b>Find</b> button will return the airfoil to the initial position. 
          </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Top</b> shows 
          the wing as viewed from above looking down onto the planform. The flow 
          is from bottom to top. Since FoilSim only solves for the two-dimensional 
          flow past objects, you won't see any flow in this view. It is provided 
          only to display the geometry of the wing area. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Side - 3D</b> 
          shows an orthographic projection of the three dimensional wing.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Moving</b> shows 
          particles flowing past the airfoil. The particles are drawn as line 
          "traces". The inclination of the trace is at the local flow angle, and 
          the left most part of the trace is the particle location. Particles 
          are being periodically released from a constant streamwise location 
          upstream of the airfoil.The streamwise distance between any two particles 
          is proportional to the local velocity. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Frozen</b> is 
          a snapshot of the moving particles. In this view, you can change the 
          streamwise release point of the particles by moving the cursor into 
          the view window, holding down the left mouse, and dragging the particles 
          to the left or right. In this view, the particles are color coded by 
          the time at which they are released. (All of the yellow particles were 
          released at the same streamwise location at the same time.)</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Streamlines

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="OUTPUT VARIABLES"></a><b>OUTPUT 
        VARIABLES</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        There are several different output options available for the
        <b>Output Window</b> at the lower right.
        You select the type of output by using the red choice
        box on the control panel. If you select <b>Plot</b>, 
        a graph will appear in the window. The type of graph is described
        below. <b>Plot Selection</b> provides a panel
        in the output window which allows you to select the
        type of plot.
        If you display a plot and begin to change the 
        input variables, it may become necessary to rescale the plot axes by 
        pushing the white <b>Rescale </b> button at the upper left of the window. 
        The types of available plots are 
        listed below. </font></p>
      <ol>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The default plot 
          is the <b>Surface Pressure</b>. The yellow line will be a plot of the 
          lower surface pressure, and the white line a plot of the upper surface 
          pressure. For reference, the green line shows the value of free stream 
          pressure.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You may also display 
          the <b>Surface Velocity</b>. As with the pressure, the yellow line will 
          be a plot of the lower surface, and the white line a plot of the upper 
          surface. If the <b>Stall Model</b> is used and the wing stalls, these 
          plots are not available.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The remaining plot 
          choices show <b>Lift</b> or <b> Lift Coefficient -Cl</b> versus each 
          of the input variables. 
          For these plots, the current value of the flow conditions is shown as 
          a red dot on the plot.</font></li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
       <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <b>Lift Meter 
          </b> shows the current value of lift (or lift coefficient) displayed 
          in scientific notation. The meter is displayed in the output window 
          and moves as the lift is varied.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <b>Probe </b> 
          lets you explore the flow around the wing. A probe control panel appears
          in the output window when you select "Probe" from the control panel.
          By default, the probe is 
          turned off. You turn the probe on by pushing one of the white buttons 
          on the probe panel. The probe itself will then appear in the view window. You 
          change the location of the probe using the sliders to the left and below 
          the gauge on the probe panel. The value of the pressure or the velocity at the location 
          of the probe tip (magenta ball on the view window) is displayed on the 
          gauge. Or a green trail of "smoke" is swept downstream from the probe 
          location. You turn the probe off by using the red button located above 
          the gauge.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <b>Performance </b> 
          option provides a written list of important input and computed variables
          in the <b>Output Window</b>. You have two options for performance output;
          the <b>Data</B> option gives the computed lift and flow conditions, the
          <b>Geom</b> option shows the coordinates of the airfoil geometry and the
          local value of velocity and pressure. These numbers correspond to the
          plots of velocity and pressure described above.
          </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        Some additional output 
        from the program is displayed on the control panel and some input panels. 
        You can choose to display the lift or the lift 
        coefficient by using the choice box on the control panel. The value 
        is displayed in the output box to the right of the choice box. Lift 
        may be expressed in either English or metric units (pounds or Newtons). 
        On the Flight Test input panel is a group of output boxes that give the 
        atmospheric conditions of the air. The pressure, 
        temperature, and density will change depending on the altitude and planetary 
        inputs. On the Size input panel the geometric <b>aspect ratio</b> of the 
        wing is displayed. The aspect ratio is defined to be the square of the 
        span divided by the wing area 
        and is included here for later calculations of wing drag.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="INPUT VARIABLES"></a><b>INPUT 
        VARIABLES</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The input variables 
        are located on input panels that are displayed at the lower left. 
        You can select the input to display by using the blue choice box on 
        the control panel. You can choose to vary the  Shape, 
        the Size, or perform a Flight 
        Test.  
        </font></p>
      <ol>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you choose to 
          <b>Flight Test</b> (the default choice), you can change the value of 
          lift by varying the speed, or the altitude. 
          You can flight test your wing on the earth (default), on Mars, or in 
          the water by using the choice box at the upper right. You can also 
          choose to specify your own values of temperature and pressure for air, 
          or to specify your own fluid by providing a value of the fluid density.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you choose <b>Shape/Angle</b>, 
          you can select a classic airfoil shape, an ellipse, or a thin plate 
          cross section by using the choice box. You can change the <b>camber, 
          thickness, </b>or the angle of attack of 
          the cross section. The definitions of these geometric variables are given 
          on the wing geometry web page. You can also 
          choose to investigate the lift created by a rotating 
          cylinder, or a spinning ball. For these 
          problems you must specify the spin rate and radius. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you choose <b>Size</b>, 
          you can vary the layout of the wing. You can change the <b>chord, span, 
          </b>or the wing area. The ratio of the span to the chord
           is called the <b>Aspect Ratio</b> and this parameter also has an
           effect
           on the lift of the wing. If you have selected 
           a cylinder or ball shape, this input panel is not used. </font></li>

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>NEW FEATURES</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Learning Technologies 
        Project will continue to improve and update FoilSim II based on user input. 
        Changes from previous versions of the program include:</font></p>
      <ol>
         <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On <b>2 Jul 09</b>,
          version 1.5b was released. This version corrects some round-off errors
          in the pressure calculations.
          </font></li>

         <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On <b>6 Feb 04</b>,
          version 1.5a was released. This version includes a slightly different
          layout of the program. The large text box is now included as an output
          option. This is the first version which is available as an undergraduate
          version and as a Java application. The undergraduate version version includes
          some additional options to better understand the analysis. The application
          allows printed output from the program. 
          </font></li>
         <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On <b>7 Oct 02</b>,
          version 1.4n was released. This version includes the effects of
          aspect ratio on lift and some small modifications suggested by users,
          including the "Rescale" option on the plots.
          </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On <b>1 Dec 00</b>, 
          version 1.4 was released. This version includes some additional shapes 
          (cylinder and ball), larger graphics output selections (density and 
          lift coefficient plots), different environments (water, non-standard 
          earth atmosphere, and specified fluid density) and a different layout 
          of the view panel. Corrections have also been made to the particle traces.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On <b>28 July 00</b>, 
          version 1.3 was released. This version includes some additional airfoil 
          shapes (ellipse and plate), larger graphics output, and a (hopefully) 
          cleaner layout of input panels.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On <b>28 Feb 00</b>, 
          a stall model was added. This model is invoked by using the blue on 
          white <b>Input Choices</b> button. The default analysis mode is <b>Ideal 
          Flow</b>, in which the stall model is turned off. If you choose <b>Stall 
          Model</b> and the angle of attack is greater than 10 degrees, you will 
          see the flow begin to separate from the surface of the airfoil, as it 
          does on real airfoils. The lift will continue to increase up to about 
          15 degrees; then it will decrease. This behavior is observed on real 
          airfoils as seen on the slide describing the effects of angle 
          of attack on lift.</font></li>
